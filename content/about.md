**Hi, my name is Rafael**. I look like Captain Haddock but in the current days, with hoodie and sneakers. I live in Norway, but I'm from Portugal. At work, I mainly develop PHP web applications. I have deep knowledge in the PHP ecosystem and Javascript too. I'm passionate about other languages such as Go.

I'm also using ReactNative at work, but I don't like to say it because I see myself as a backend developer and not frontend/mobile developer. Anyway, the app I developed has 80.000 consistent users and I feel proud.

I practice Parkour since 2007, like to edit videos of my jumps and also photos.
