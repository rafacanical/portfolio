Most of my work is private code of my company, but I'm starting to do more Open Source code on my freetime. **Check some projects I've been developing:**

* [**Feal & Feal CLI**](https://github.com/rafmst/feal) - Feal is an API boilerplate that uses Koa with Typescript and MongoDB, with its own CLI tool;
* [**AllSpots**](https://github.com/rafmst/allspots-api) - A catalog of parkour spots around the world, with images, description and map locations;
* [**Miter**](https://github.com/rafmst/miter) - Ratio calculator on your terminal (coded w/ Nim);
* [**Propor**](https://github.com/rafmst/propor) - Ratio calculator on your terminal (coded w/ Typescript).
