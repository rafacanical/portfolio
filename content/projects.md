Most of my work is private code of my company, but I'm starting to do some Open Source code on my freetime. **Check some projects I've been developing:**

* [**@mowgli**](https://github.com/rafmst/mowgli "@mowgli") - Mowgli is a simplified bundle of React Native components.
* [**Nau**](https://github.com/rafmst/nau "Nau") - Nau is a boilerplate for Go projects using fiber framework and MongoDB.
* [**Propor**](https://github.com/rafmst/propor "Propor") - Ratio calculator on your terminal.
