Most of my work is private code of my company, but I'm starting to do some Open Source code on my freetime. **Check some projects I've been developing:**

* **[Caravela](https://github.com/rafamrs/caravela)** - Personal interactive CLI tool for developers and translators.
* **[Miter](https://github.com/rafamrs/miter)** - Ratio calculator on your terminal.
