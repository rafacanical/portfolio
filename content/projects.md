Most of my work is private code of my company, but I'm starting to do some Open Source code on my freetime. **Check some projects I've been developing:**

* **[Featquest](https://github.com/rafamrs/featquest)** - Open source feature request platform, just copy and use it as you will. *(production)*
* **[Miter](https://github.com/rafamrs/miter)** - Ratio calculator on your terminal.
