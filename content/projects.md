Most of my work is private code of my company, but I'm starting to do some Open Source code on my freetime. **Check some projects I've been developing:**

* [**Bard**](https://github.com/rafmst/bard "Bard") - Bard is a blog platform written with Vue.js + Firebase + Tailwind CSS.
* [**Caravela**](https://github.com/rafmst/caravela) - Personal interactive CLI tool for developers and translators.
* [**Miter**](https://github.com/rafmst/miter) - Ratio calculator on your terminal.
