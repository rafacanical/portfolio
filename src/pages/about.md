**Hey there, I'm Rafael!** 👋 I'm a fullstack developer from Portugal living in Norway. I've been coding professionally since 2014. At work, I mainly develop PHP projects with Symfony framework, and most recently a React Native(Typescript) app with over 100k users. I have deep knowledge in the PHP ecosystem and Javascript too. I'm really passionate about Typescript and Nim and thats what I use outside of work.

On my free time I like to code my little projects with Nim and I practice Parkour since 2007, I like to edit videos of my jumps and also photos.

If you want to contact me, please use any of my social networks.
